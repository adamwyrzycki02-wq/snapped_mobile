## 🚀 Available Development Workflows

### Option 1: Native iOS Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open ios/SnappedAI.xcworkspace

# Or use command line
npm run ios:simulator
npm run ios:local
```

### Option 2: Expo Development (Still Available)
```bash
npm start
npm run ios
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Develop with Expo for rapid iteration
- Switch to Xcode for native features and final builds

## 📱 TestFlight Deployment Options

### Method 1: Xcode (Local Build)
1. Open `ios/SnappedAI.xcworkspace`
2. Product → Archive
3. Upload to App Store Connect

### Method 2: EAS Build (Cloud)
```bash
npm run build:ios:production
npm run submit:ios
```

### Method 3: Command Line (Local)
```bash
npm run build:ios:local
```

## 🔧 Next Steps for You

### Immediate Setup (Required)
1. **Install CocoaPods** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

2. **Install iOS dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open ios/SnappedAI.xcworkspace
   ```

### Development Setup
1. **Configure Apple Developer Account** in Xcode
2. **Set up signing & capabilities** for your team
3. **Test on iOS Simulator** and physical device
4. **Configure TestFlight** in App Store Connect

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Start with Expo** for rapid development: `npm start`
2. **Switch to Xcode** when you need native features
3. **Use Xcode** for final builds and TestFlight deployment
